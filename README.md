# Search Engine - Info
This repository contains a simple search engine design that is user friendly and easy-to-use. This code includes a mixture of HTML5 and internal CSS, it consists of two essential elements such as structure and style. I'm pleased with the results and hope to update this project over time.


The challenge was the algorithmic challenges of compactly representing an extensive data set while supporting fast searches. The search engine project is inspired by many renowned brands such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo.

<p>While it may lack some of the core features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Data Files for the search engine.</li>
  <li>Page titles, keyword density, and content.</li>
  <li>Machine learning and AI-driven relevance/ranking.</li>
  <li>Cloud services</li>
  <li>and much more!</li>
</ul>

This project still consists of two essential parts: structure and style.
