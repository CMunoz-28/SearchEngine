# SearchEngine
The overall goal of this project was to develop a simple search engine design. 

The challenge was the algorithmic challenges of compactly representing an extensive data set while supporting fast searches. The search engine project is inspired by many renowned brands such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo.
While it may lack some of the core features:
<ul>
  <li>Data Files for the search engine.</li>
  <li>Page titles, keyword density, and content.</li>
  <li>Machine learning and AI-driven relevance/ranking.</li>
  <li>Cloud services</li>
  <li>and much more!</li>
</ul>


However, this project still consists of two essential parts: structure and style.
Overall, I'm proud to have accomplished this project, and more will come with my knowledge of HTML & CSS
